    "A big benefit of using Neural Networks and espeically using a framework like pytorch is, that it is incredibly flexible. We can easily adjust our network structure in variious ways:  Multiple Sesaonalities, Hierachical models. Sharing season, trend or level between series. Including externel regressors or indicators. Using Multiple time series etc... "
